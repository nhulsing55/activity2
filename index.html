            My name is Nick Hulsing. I go to University of Nebraska at Omaha to study Management Information Systems.
                I am in my last semester of college. I am hoping to graduate this December with my bachelors in MIS.
                I like cars and enjoy playing video games with friends. The picture to the left is me at Ka Lae, which
                is on the Big Island of Hawaii. It is the southernmost point of the Big Island of Hawaii and of the
                50 United States. This was an amazing experience for me; I saw the ocean for the first time in Hawaii.
                This is a simple website that I designed for my Web Application Development class.
                Enjoy!
            </p>
