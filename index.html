            My name is Nick Hulsing. I go to University of Nebraska at Omaha to study Management Information Systems.
                I am in my last semester of college. I am hoping to graduate this December with my bachelors in MIS.
                I like cars and enjoy playing video games with friends. This is a simple website that I designed
                for my Web Application Development class. Enjoy!
            </p>
