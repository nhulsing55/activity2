        <p>The Subaru WRX is one of the best bang for your buck sports car you can get on the market. The car has a history
        of being a rally car. The car is AWD, so it is a great car to use year-round. The car's MPG is 21 in the
        city and 27 on the highway. The WRX is loaded with 268 horsepower, making it a fun little car. The best part
        about the WRX is that it comes with a manual transmission.</p>
